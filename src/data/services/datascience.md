Our team leads the way in nimble machine learning insights from text.

We are experts in Natural Language Processing, including Named Entity
Recognition; topic modeling with Latent Dirichlet Allocation, BERT;
Transformers; abstractive and extractive summarization; explainable ML;
sentiment analysis.

As a bootstrapped company, however, we focus on working, practical software. We
want our software to solve real problems and return real value.
